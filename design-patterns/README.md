- **Singleton Pattern**:  
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- **Factory Method Pattern**: 
Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating the instance.

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: 
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **Template Method Pattern**: 
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

- **Observer Pattern**: 
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- **Decorator Pattern**: 
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

- **Command Pattern**: 
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests.

- **Adapter Pattern**: 
Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

- **Facade Pattern**:
Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

- **Proxy Pattern**: 
Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

- **Composite Pattern**: 
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- **State Pattern**: 
Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

- **Strategy Pattern**: 
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

- **Iterator Pattern**:
Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

- **Command Pattern**: 
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests.
